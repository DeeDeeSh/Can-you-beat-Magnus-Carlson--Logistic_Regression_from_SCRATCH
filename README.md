# 🧠 Can You Beat Magnus Carlsen? | Logistic Regression from Scratch

* This project implements Logistic Regression from scratch in Python, without using .fit() or machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

* It predicts your chance of beating Magnus Carlsen, the highest-rated chess player in history — using synthetic data generated with help from ChatGPT.

**📊 Features Used**

*Number of Grandmasters beaten*

*Elo Rating*

*Average rating of last 50 opponents*

**🔧 What I Learned**

* Implementing logistic regression manually

* Gradient descent and cost function computation

* Feature normalization (Z-score)

* Making predictions without ML libraries

* eploying models using Streamlit
